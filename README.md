# Design Patterns (.NET C#)

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
* Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist
  * Singleton (not thread safe)
  * Singleton (thread safe - .NET 4 Lazy T type)
#### Factory Method
* Creates an instance of several derived classes

### Structural Patterns

#### Adapter 
* Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.

#### Decorator
* Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.

### Behavioral Patterns

#### Template Method 
* Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

#### State
* Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
