* Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist
  * Singleton (not thread safe)
  * Singleton (thread safe - .NET 4 Lazy T type)
* Factory Method - Creates an instance of several derived classes

### Structural Patterns
* Adapter - Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.
* Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.

### Behavioral Patterns
* Template Method - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
